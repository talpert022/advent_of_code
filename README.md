| 2021/problem5 | `1:35:32` | - Parsing of input lines in python be written a lot cleaner with `split(delimiter)`, or using regex, rather than a for loop over the strings characters <br> - when using a 2d array, x positions are columns (elements in array) and y positions are rows (arrays in matrix). When retrieving a value from the array you use `array[row][col]` <br> - `cord_str` and `cord_idx` are too similar of variables <br> - learn numpy for array manipulation <br> - reading problem more carefully would have helped recognize all lines were either vertical horizontal or diagonal <br> Using a [direction array](https://github.com/womogenes/AoC-2021-Solutions/blob/7a3fa845af3eb5f56b499121ac2876a899afc4e5/day_05/day_05_p2.py#L25) would have made traversing vent lines simpler |
| 2021/problem6 | `1:14:54` | - I did well with using a dictionary in my solution. It reduced time complexity by a lot and reduced code complexity around not lowering the age of new born fish <br> - Got stuck when I didn't realize I forgot a temp variable. Always use the tuple (`a,b = b,a`) syntax when swapping values. Overall go through code walkthrough slower with less assumptions things will work how you expect. Using debugger was helpful even though I was stuck with it this time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
