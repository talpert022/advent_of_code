## Python language pickups

-   The `zip()` built-in function in python will combine the elements of an array at the same index or the characters of a string at the same index into a zip object -> that becomes a list of tuples when you give it to the list function
-   Using `(param = value)` in the definition of a function provides a default value for the parameter that you don't have to pass while calling the function
-   The all() function is the same as using "and" multiple times and its useful for taking a for loop as a parameter combining multiple conditions like: `all(x < 5 for x in range(10))`

My mind just didn't think of that idek <br> - In the future, I should estimate the time to complete, and possible down the road challenges, before I implement something <br> - sorting strings is a good way of finding equality of string permutations of the same length, while comparing sets have useful methods when not the same length like `.issubset()` and `.intersection()`                                                                                            |

It fit perfectly into the use case of finding questions at least one person answered yes to, which is basically eliminating multiples. Then for part 2, the intersection between multiple sets was the simplest and fastest conceptualization of finding shared answers between multiple people. For a second I was considering an iterative approach but this would involve a triple for loop per group, checking matching questions between the first person and every other person in the group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

A lot of solutions use a similar strategy (some with a [dictionary](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zac2v2/comment/iyl8huv/?context=3)). Because each result increments the score a multiple of three, and your hand goes increments the score between those multiples, each hand is unique. <br> - [This solution](https://github.com/hyper-neutrino/advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/day02p1.py) uses a cool insight for RPS that the winning play is always the word to the right of its predecessor in 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'. So by mapping each letter to 0,1,2 you can find the diffence between them and calculate the score based on that.
